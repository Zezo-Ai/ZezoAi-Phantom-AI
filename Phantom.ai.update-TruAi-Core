# 🧠 Phantom.ai — AI Screen Upgrade Plan

**Mode:** Cursor-Style Unified Interaction
**Scope:** Workspace → AI Execution Surface
**Architecture:** HTML / CSS / JS + PHP (localhost:8080)
**Status:** Proposed (Ready for Implementation)

---

## 1. OBJECTIVE (CLEAR)

Upgrade the existing AI interaction screen so the user can:

* Type natural language instructions
* Upload files and images directly
* Provide web URLs as context
* Receive AI responses inline (code + text)
* Allow the AI to **read and modify system options** *within defined boundaries*
* Maintain full auditability and deterministic behavior

This screen becomes the **primary AI execution interface**, similar to Cursor, but compliant with Phantom.ai constraints.

---

## 2. CORE PRINCIPLES (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

* **Single unified input surface**
* **Explicit context visibility** (no hidden data)
* **AI cannot act silently**
* **All changes require human confirmation**
* **All actions logged**

---

## 3. AI SCREEN — FUNCTIONAL LAYOUT (MINIMAL)

### A. Unified Input Panel (Top or Center)

**Purpose:** Primary command interface

**Components**

* Multiline text input
  *“Describe what you want the AI to do…”*
* Submit button (`Send to AI`)
* Keyboard shortcut (Enter / Shift+Enter)

**Behavior**

* Input is stored as a task snapshot
* Cannot be overwritten after submission (history preserved)

---

### B. Context Attachment Panel (Inline / Expandable)

**Purpose:** Cursor-style context loading

**Supported Inputs**

* 📄 File upload (PHP, JS, CSS, JSON, MD)
* 🖼 Image upload (SVG, PNG, JPG)
* 🌐 Web URL input (read-only fetch or snapshot)
* 📁 Project file selector (existing files)

**Controls**

* Include / Exclude toggles per item
* Remove context item before send

**Rules**

* Context is explicitly listed
* AI only sees what is checked
* Context list is logged

---

### C. AI Response Panel (Primary Output)

**Purpose:** Display AI output

**Content Types**

* Text explanation
* Code blocks (syntax highlighted)
* Structured changes (diff-style when possible)

**Controls**

* Copy
* Save to artifacts
* Send to Review
* Escalate to Copilot (if allowed)

---

### D. AI-Accessible Settings Panel (Controlled)

**Purpose:** Allow AI to optimize workflow **without breaking safety**

**Settings AI May Propose Changes To**

* AI Tier (Cheap / Mid / Copilot)
* Escalation mode (Auto / Forced)
* Context inclusion rules
* Output format (text / code / diff)
* Workflow hints (review vs generate)

**Critical Rule**

> AI **proposes**, user **approves**

**UI Mechanism**

* “AI Suggests Change” banner
* Accept / Reject per suggestion
* No silent changes

---

## 4. INTERACTION FLOW (AUTHORITATIVE)

```text
User Input + Context
        ↓
AI Execution
        ↓
AI Response Rendered
        ↓
(Optional) AI Suggests Setting Changes
        ↓
User Accepts / Rejects
        ↓
Output Saved → Review → Files
```

No shortcuts. No hidden automation.

---

## 5. CURSOR PARITY FEATURES (ALLOWED)

| Feature                    | Supported | Notes                    |
| -------------------------- | --------- | ------------------------ |
| Inline AI response         | ✅         | Read-only until accepted |
| File upload                | ✅         | Explicit context         |
| Image input                | ✅         | Context only             |

| Silent changes             | ❌         | Forbidden                |

---

## 6. SECURITY & AUDIT (MANDATORY)

Every AI interaction must log:

* User ID
* Timestamp
* Input text
* Context items
* AI tier used
* Suggested setting changes
* User approvals/rejections

Stored in:

```
logs/audit.log
artifacts/ai-history/
```

---

## 7. IMPLEMENTATION NOTES (LOCKED STACK)

* **HTML**

  * `<textarea>` for input
  * `<input type="file">` for uploads
  * `<input type="url">` for web context
* **JS**

  * Context manager
  * Response renderer
  * Approval gate logic
* **PHP**

  * Context validation
  * File storage
  * AI execution routing
  * Audit logging

No Node. No frameworks.

---

## 8. EFFICIENCY OPPORTUNITIES (SAFE OPTIMIZATIONS)

* Remember last context set per task
* Auto-collapse context panel after send
* Highlight changed sections in AI output
* One-click “Send to Review”

All optional. None implicit.

---

## 9. OUT OF SCOPE (FOR NOW)

* Real-time streaming tokens
* Background execution
* Autonomous agent loops
* Multi-user simultaneous editing

---

## 10. STATUS

✅ Architecture compliant
✅ Cursor-style interaction achieved
✅ Security preserved
✅ Audit intact
✅ Ready for implementation or Copilot escalation

---

If you want next steps, say one of:

* **“Generate HTML scaffold for AI screen”**
* **“Create Copilot implementation prompt (short)”**
* **“Add AI-settings proposal rules”**
* **“Integrate with Review workflow”**

Phantom.ai remains **minimal, powerful, and defensible**.

Below is the **authoritative Phantom.ai update**, integrating **AI-based self-maintenance / upgrade / modification on command**, without breaking architecture, security, or auditability.

This is written as a **drop-in extension** to the previously approved plan.

---

Acknowledged. This update is now **canonically defined** and locked under a new core identity.

Below is the **authoritative system-level confirmation and integration**—no design changes, no fluff.

---

## 8. SAFETY BOUNDARIES (ENFORCED)

❌ No auto-merge
❌ No silent file writes
❌ No dependency changes
❌ No new tooling (Node, Vite, etc.)
❌ No schema changes without migration plan

✅ Diff-based output only
✅ Human acceptance required

---

## 9. AUDIT & TRACEABILITY (REQUIRED)

Each self-maintenance task logs:

* Command text
* AI source used
* Proposed plan
* Approved scope
* Files touched
* Outcome (accepted/rejected)

Stored under:

```
logs/maintenance.log
artifacts/self-maintenance/
```

---

## 10. UI ADDITION (MINIMAL)

Add **one** new control only:

### “AI Maintenance Command” Input

* Text input (single or multiline)
* Disabled unless Maintenance Mode = ON
* Clearly labeled **“System Modification Command”**

No other UI expansion required.

---

## 11. EFFICIENCY BENEFITS (INTENDED)

* Faster internal upgrades
* Safer refactors
* Reduced manual repetition
* Predictable system evolution

Without sacrificing control.

---

## 12. STATUS
